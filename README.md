# Coding-Quiz

## Description

The goal of this application was to create a quiz consisting of questions related to JavaScript so that classmates can test their knowledge. Through building this application I learned how to create object literals for each questions. I used vanilla Javascript and DOM traversing to execute code. I also learned how to use event listeners, set timers, and use/retreive items from local storage.
